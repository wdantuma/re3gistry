## About the Re3gistry

![Logo](documentation/images/logo.png)

The Re3gistry software is a reusable open-source solution for **managing and sharing ‘reference codes’** through persistent URIs, ensuring that concepts are unambiguously referenced in any domain.

> Reference codes can be sets of permissible values for a data field or to provide a reference or context for the data being exchanged between applications. Examples of reference codes are enumerations, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri or, simply, ‘lists of things’.

Licensed under the **[EUPL](http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/eupl.html)**, Re3gistry is an open-source project that can be deployed and further developed by contributors from any sector, check out the Re3gistry Governance and contribution guidelines below.
A copy of the license is available in the repository's [LICENSE](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

## What Re3gistry offers you?

> The Re3gistry provides a central access point where labels and descriptions for reference codes are easily accessible by both humans and machines while fostering **semantic interoperability across organisations**.

Managing reference codes setting up registries (systems of registers) helps:

* **Avoiding common mistakes** such as misspellings, entering synonyms, or filling out online forms.
* **Facilitating the internationalisation of user interfaces** by providing multilingual labels.
* **Ensuring semantic interoperability** when exchanging data between systems and applications.
* **Tracing changes over time** throuhg a well documented versioning system.
* **Increasing the value of the reference codes**, if widely reused and referenced
